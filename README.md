# RetinaGuard: AI-Powered Diabetic Retinopathy Screening System

RetinaGuard is a full-stack clinical decision-support platform for automated Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) screening and triage. It combines deterministic fundus image quality verification, deep learning classification (EfficientNet-B0), lesion detection, explainability (Grad-CAM), and a modern clinical dashboard.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Automated Image Quality Gate**: Rule-based OpenCV quality assessment (blur, illumination, contrast, FOV, artifacts) preventing ungradable scans from reaching the classifier.
- **Deep Learning DR Grading**: EfficientNet-B0 model classifying retinal fundus images into 5 ICDR severity levels:
  - 0: No DR
  - 1: Mild NPDR
  - 2: Moderate NPDR (Referable)
  - 3: Severe NPDR (Referable)
  - 4: Proliferative DR (Referable)
- **Clinical Explainability**: Grad-CAM heatmaps highlighting pathological regions guiding clinical attention.
- **Interactive Clinical Dashboard**: React + TypeScript frontend featuring patient worklists, screening history, clinical review queue, and analytics.
- **RESTful API**: Fast, asynchronous FastAPI backend with automated validation and reporting.
